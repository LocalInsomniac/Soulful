# Soulful

An atmosphere-based randomizer mod for GZDoom.

Maps are automatically detailed with grass and decoration variants, some of which are also destructible.

Different unique monsters can spawn based on the current atmosphere of their spawning area, whether it be grassy, gloomy or fiery.

New barrel variants that change your strategies via flames or supplies.

Basically? Just your typical, boring randomizer... but on steroids.
